  * tailwindcss
* In Future, For the Server side it will have the backend packages like -
  * Node.js 
  * Express.js(CORS middleware) 
  * Socket.io 
  * Nodemon
    
# Setting up the client-side 
Firstly, the design is completely mine, asthetics is an important part that I always try to maintain in all of my projects.
The home page design was build using a tailwind css and I m using there SAAS css also for better development.
The responsive design of the page using media queries will run when opened in a mobile-device.
Secondly, for Next.Js file structure there are main page were created page.js(Homepage) and pricing.js(Price Page) and amny more. All the other components were created on top of these main components 

# Deployment
The app is deployed using Vercel.
